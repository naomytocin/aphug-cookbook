# aphug cookbook !!

this is the repository where all the site's code is stored.

## the code

this project is using [qwik](https://qwik.dev/) alongside [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). they're really cool, you should check them out.

this project was a really nice learning experience on how to use the qwik framework to make a website. i find it tremendously fascinating and cool and am probably going to use it for other websites i make too.

uhm yea that's all i have to say, i should really learn how to make a readme.md file properly.
